# Netflix Dashboard on Tableau 


## Overview :  
Netflix is a leading streaming service offering a vast library of movies, TV shows, and documentaries.
With its user-friendly interface and diverse content offerings, Netflix has revolutionized how we 
consume entertainment. From binge-worthy series to critically acclaimed films, Netflix caters to a global 
audience's entertainment needs easily.

## My Work :
I wanted to create a project that provides an interactive Tableau dashboard where users can explore details and reviews about shows and movies on Netflix. The dashboard showcases the overview of each movie or TV show, including details like duration, rating, date added, genre, and a brief description. Additionally, it features cool elements such as a map page showing the total number of movies and TV shows by country, a bar graph displaying the most-watched movies and TV shows across various ratings, another bar graph highlighting the top 10 genres, a bubble chart depicting the total number of shows and movies on Netflix over time, and an area graph illustrating the uploads of movies and TV shows over time.
